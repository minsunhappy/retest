The group consists of three men dressed in black, one of whom is wearing a black mask, and one man in a gray jacket and white shirt. As the man in white approaches, he begins to raise his right hand. The man in white continues to walk forward and raises his right hand higher. The group of men, including the one in the gray jacket, watch him intently. The man in white fully extends his right arm, pointing towards the group.
