A lot of what you saw in Home Alone is what Mac would do to the bad guys, the only difference is that he never planned things out, many of what MacGyver did was on the fly and improvised. Used all kinds of objects to his advantage and make them into an explosive, a trap...etc. pretty much anything to use to either distract or take out the bad guys. When the writers made these Home Alone movies, they used some of the ideas from the show which by the way MacGyver was still on TV when the first Home Alone movie came out. Then recently CBS rebooted the show.",
