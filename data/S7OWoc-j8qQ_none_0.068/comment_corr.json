Home Alone had so many cool parts, like when Polka King helped Kate back to Kevin, or when Kevin found out Old Man Marley was good, or when Kevin set the traps, and when Kevin shot Harry and Marv with the BB gun, or when Kevin placed Buzz's tarantula on Marv's face, and he shrieked like a girl, and when Harry and Marv fell for the traps. Home Alone went downhill more quickly than  the internet went downhill. Now Home Alone movies are boring pieces of junk.

But all that time me and my family and cousin were watching Home Alone 2, I was definitely curious as to what Harry was talking about when he said \"Wait. Don't you remember what happened last year?\" And then by the time I turned 8, I finally got to see Home Alone 1. And the answer was right in front of me. Kevin had used paint cans on Harry and Marv before. And that's why Harry strategized he'd be doing the same thing again when they walked up the stairs",
