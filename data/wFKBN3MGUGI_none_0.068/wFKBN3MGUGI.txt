  [[I feel like this is a story of a man who accomplished so many timeless and great things in life, made a great deal of money, and made it to the top of what is societaly considered to be the ultimate successful life. But in his wise old age he looks into the eyes of the young audience in the darkened room, almost every face 50 years younger than him. He has seen the great times and the bad times, the rain and the sunshine, year after year. He surpasses the laughers and the mockers and knows that for a fact deep down. He's on a whole other level of enlightenment that they might not ever achieve, and they have not a clue that they have just been givien one of the greatest gifts of all time. The perspective of life from someone who's seen the other side. Someone who's experienced it all and has come to a realization that everything shouldn't be taken so seriously in life. He confidently conveys through his jovial smile, "THIS, my young friends is what life is about. Don't be fooled."]]
